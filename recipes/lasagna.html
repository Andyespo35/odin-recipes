    <p>Lasagna is a classic dish that tastes incredible, but absolutely destroys my stomach.</p>
    <p>You see, I have something that plagues 36% of Americans - I am extremely lactose intolerant. Like I actually broke a record for most lactose intolerant 
        human that has ever been tested at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. What especially hurts is that I am Italian. I am forced to eat lasagna every year on Christmas 
        eve before I eat fish. Every Christmas Eve I go to bed in agonizing pain. All that being said, Lasagna is incredible and you should read this so you can 
        enjoy everything lasagna has to offer. </p>
